\f0\fs24 \cf0 the w3schools is shit. this has been extensively documented, and even has spawned the wonderful w3fools site, which valiantly strikes down the disinformation propagated by the jackasses at w3schools. however, whenever I google something html- or css- (or even basic javascript-) related, I get the pesky w3schools results back. lame. fortunately, chrome has a delicious little extension called 'search filter' that does just that. now, you can get proper answers when you need them!}
