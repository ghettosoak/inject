<h5>30.11.13</h5><h1>On education</h1><p>After working a full work week in just four days;</p>

<p>After working a half work week in two days to regain the creative energy that the previous four took;</p>

<p>After getting the text asking if I'll be able to make it back to Chicago for a funeral;</p>

<p>After getting the text about my grandpa's wife dragging him to California to die;</p>

<p>After the panic of what that rumble coming from my phone might be;</p>

<p>After the panic of losing a day to the weekend;</p>

<p>After the longing for friends and family that I just can't attend to right now;</p>

<p>I simply don't have anything left.</p>
