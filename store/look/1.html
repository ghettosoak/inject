<h3>people will only put up with you not speaking the native language for only so long</h3>

<p>switzerland is unique in that the country is, in fact, quadlingual. we have german, french, italian, and a mountain people-only language called rumansch. it sounds suspiciously close to italian, and I'm told that it is easily understood by portuguese folk. the country is fairly divided along these lines, as well: divided in the sense that you can enter what you would swear to be italy by simply going a few clicks to the south, still remaining in swiss sovereign territory. the same thing goes for the french part. not only does the language change, but the architecture, the cuisine, and the general feel of the place changes as well. we like to think of ourselves as well integrated in the U S of A, but these folk here really understand what it means to have dissonant people living in one country. hilariously enough, each segment of the country has a distinctly difficult time speaking the others language. for the most part.</p>

<p>and it is through this understood dissonance that the swiss are also surprisingly well versed in english. at least, the folk in the german speaking part – the 'italians' are not as understanding – but then, the rest of the continent doesn't really have the same 'problem' with vast cultural adoption as we have here, so learning english is not such a tremendous deal for people who are already at the very least already bilingual. consider the fact that swiss german itself is effectively another language unto itself, and making pointed contact with the outside world isn't such a half bad idea, after all.</p>

<p>with the outside world, that is. the story differs slightly for folks on the inside. while they are vastly more tolerant of foreigners than we could ever hope to be back in america, there is a limit to what can be expected in terms of communication: especially when it comes down to the workplace, in a profession that relies so heavily upon the sound and exacting communication of ideas. of course, I was remiss to take this into consideration when I made the jump over here: I knew that I would learn german eventually, but I suppose the speed at which I myself would be expected to be proficient in the language was underestimated.</p>

<p>in the introductory emails between myself and the business-end of the agency that I now work for, it was made very clear that german is a rather important part of their workflow, despite their position as an international agency. the folks there have been extremely accommodating to my german deficiency, speaking english where they can, and even enrolling me in private german lessons. I've been at the agency for about six weeks now, and I've been in the country for about four months now, during which I'd like to think I've learned a whole lot about the german language. but it's only been within the last week that a tremendous push to begin speaking primarily german  has begun to take shape – it would seem that the tolerance has finally run out, and I am at the end of my english rope. my progress is quite the object of fascination with my colleagues, and they are beyond supportive of my newfound 'habit'. but, strange as it sounds, when living in a country that speaks primarily german, you must learn to adapt, and do so quickly.</p>

<h3>…but when you do finally start speaking the native language, it's awesome</h3>

<p>this leads me to my next point rather neatly however: while this expectation may have been a pinch hurried, the competency behind it has certainly been a long time in the coming. my first wholehearted attempt at speaking pure german was in a club somewhere in downtown luzern with whom I can remember as a short lady with oddly shaped pants. she nodded patiently as I plodded on, attempting to string together words that I had learned (at that point) well over a year ago with the very limited knowledge of the verbs 'to be' and 'to have'. she didn't speak any english, so our interaction was reserved solely to german, and I still can't quite remember what she said to me (much less what I said to her). but german it was, and in addition to being curiously awesome, it marked the beginning of my fluency with german.</p>

<p>since then, as of the time of this writing, I am becoming more and more fluent with german by the day. my grasp of the past tense is still extremely rudimentary, prepositions are still a rather profound grey area, the accusative, dative and genitive cases are a complete fucking mystery to me, among what I am sure is a vast and widening chasm, given that every bit of german goodness that is cemented in my cranium just sheds light on several more unknowns – but all parts are present, accounted for, and growing defiantly. and speaking german</p>

<h3>you're still an american, and therefore considered adequately stupid</h3>

<p>it's never said aloud. it may be inferred, just like lawyers – everyone, except for you – but it's unmistakable. you're an american, and you're brainwashed, fat, narrow minded, with a rampant twang.</p>

<p>every last time any of my co-workers detects the slightest hint of anything but pure, unadulterated morgan freeman-speech, they pounce on it. I'm from the midwest, with a hair of a chicagoan accent flying loose every once in a great while, but I also have family and friends from what might be considered 'the boonies', from whom I may have picked up a few minor phonic characteristics. but hold an 'ah' a shade too long, or dip an 'er' the slightest bit to deep, and you're larry the fucking cable guy. it's all in good fun, of course: it's never anything mean-spirited, and the swiss are hardly a people to talk, with words like 'aalüüte' passing as normal; but it's curious.</p>

<p>of course, things can get mean: on one such occasion, I staged a simple test to illustrate to some friends just how effective the ambiance of an american could be. I approached a cluster of females in a club one evening, and introduced myself as an american. their response? I've seen cripples in wheelchairs get better reactions. fortunately, I'm tough as nails, so I headbutted all of them after I stole and downed their drinks; but the american, as a marque, still has a long, long way to go.</p>

<p>and then things get plain old obnoxious. I'm presently making a website for a guy who, almost completely out of the blue, decided to pull the target date forward in time by a week. for reference, the project was to be due in two weeks. for the slow, he's halved my development time. fortunately, I'm at an agency that isn't afraid to punch people in the balls, so the original target date is back on – but you can imagine my confusion when he drops this bomb squarely in my lap. almost comically, this comes during the one week the ball-punchers / project managers are on holiday, almost like he was waiting to spring an impossible deadline on the gullible american.</p>

<p>c'mon, rest of the world: sure, we kept an idiot in the white house for 8 years, then promptly elected another – but you're no fucking golden boy either.</p>
