I instead opted for choice C â€“ to teach myself HTML. I was studying graphic design at the time, and I knew my university offered a course somewhere that attempted to link programming with design, but I also knew that the security of my career would become greatly emboldened with every tidbit of knowledge I could gather. of course, my dad would have none of this: according to him, aich-tee-ehm-ell was something that middle schoolers learned when they weren't preoccupied with halo or drinking mouthwash or whatever it is middleschoolers do.</p>

<p>so instead, I took a philosophy course, and taught myself web programming anyways.</p>
