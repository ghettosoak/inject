<p>the saying goes, 'its all greek to me', at least when your talking about something so complicated that it borders on unintelligible. it's hard not to see where this originated from: I've taken more coherent shits than the greek alphabet, and most greeks I know are assholes anyways. (related? hardly. relevant? always) but despite my irrational hatred for greece, learning another language is downright tough. there's a reason people major in it at university, it's its own discipline of study altogether.</p>

<p>I studied spanish for four years in high school, but that kinda doesn't count. my spanish is still pretty good: I once had a banker in Barcelona convinced that I had an account at his bank; but I'd hardly say that I'm fluent. I know enough to be dangerous. still, having learned another language other than my mother tongue definitely opens up the pores of your mind to receive another language… or so I thought.</p>

<p>case in point: I'm learning german. mind you, this is not your half-assed high school mickey mouse shit – this is full fledged immersion. speak german, or die. sort of. and I'd like to think that I've done pretty damn good so far: I started out, two years and some change ago, purely by listening. having a german speaking girlfriend helped too. I left for a while, but when I came back, I picked up where I left off, and enlisted the help of my girlfriend (again) and her mother, who (then) understood english just about as much as I understood german. we helped each other a lot. when I interviewed at the company I'm at now, one of my now-bosses spoke to me purely in german, both for the interview, and for the welcome-aboard meeting where he explained to me the finer points of my contract; and I understood him. since then, they've enrolled me with a private tutor who I see once a week. I've been seeing her about a month now.</p>

<p>that's the numerics of it, but the personal side of it goes a lot deeper. when you can understand what someone is telling you, it ought to be obvious. but when it's in another language, it's just fucking awesome.</p>
