AND, all those fancy 3D CSS transforms work like clockwork. it is precisely the way a browser – both for development and for leisure – should work. I wholeheartedly endorse it for both. thanks for saving the day, chromium – not to mention my monitors, and my criminal record! : )</p>

<p>UPDATE. it turns out that the folks behind chromium have (wisely) dropped support for all video codecs that aren't open source. this is really great for the state of the open and free web, but it kinda makes developing pages with video in them a pain in the dick. I still stand by my previous endorsement that chromium is the best browser to do any serious web development in, but make sure that you've got proper fallback coverage – which, you should have done anyways! : )</p>
